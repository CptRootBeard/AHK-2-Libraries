class CursorType
{
	static Dynamic[] => 2 ;;Uses a dynamic cursor. Additions, changes, and deletions by other users are visible, and all types of movement through the Recordset are allowed, except for bookmarks, if the provider doesn't support them.
	static ForwardOnly[] => 0 ;;Default. Uses a forward-only cursor. Identical to a static cursor, except that you can only scroll forward through records. This improves performance when you need to make only one pass through a Recordset.
	static Keyset[] => 1 ;;Uses a keyset cursor. Like a dynamic cursor, except that you can't see records that other users add, although records that other users delete are inaccessible from your Recordset. Data changes by other users are still visible.
	static Static[] => 3 ;;Uses a static cursor, which is a static copy of a set of records that you can use to find data or generate reports. Additions, changes, or deletions by other users are not visible.
	static Unspecified[] => -1 ;;Does not specify the type of cursor.
