# ADO
This library provides a light factory class for creating ADO objects. It also defines several enums as classes with static, get-only properties.

The ADO class also contains a method called .loadRecordSet, which will convert an open ADO recordset into an array of Mapped values in AHK 2.
This is useful when you want to read in all the data for a recordset at once.
