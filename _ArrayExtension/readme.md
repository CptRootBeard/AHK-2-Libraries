# Extending the Array Class
This script adds several methods to the array class - most meant to mimic some sort of JS functionality.
Most notable are the .MapFunc(), .some(), .every(), and .sort() methods.

MapFunc can take a fat arrow functions as input, which allows for some very nice JS-like syntax when dealing with entire arrays of data at once.
