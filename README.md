# AHK-2-Libraries
Contains my public libraries for use with AHK 2. All scripts use the *.ahk2 extension, so change extensions as needed.

I am currently using a somewhat unique project structure, though I am looking for an easy way to make this structure cross-compatible with AHK's built-in library include system.
