# Outlook Helpers
These scripts define enums for use with the Outlook COM object.
The enums are by no means exhaustive, but use static, get-only properties within classes to define the enums.

I've included the spreadsheet that converts the enum table (pulled straight from Microsoft) to AHK 2 code by means of a PowerQuery function in Excel.
